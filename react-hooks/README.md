This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


### UseState()

Hooks -> 
Context - 
 const ExampleContext = createContext();
useContext - that allows us to drastically simplify the above example, and when combined with useState, allows us to build the same component in a semantic manner:
      const {color, setColor} = useContext(ExampleContext);

## Material-ui

Typography -
-- variants include body1, title, display2, and so on. 
-- align - center the text horizontally, and gutterBottom which adds a bottom margin
